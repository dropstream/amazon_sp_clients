## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) procedure and then run the following code:
```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'sp_uploads_2020'

api_instance = SpUploads2020::UploadsApi.new
marketplace_ids = ['marketplace_ids_example'] # Array<String> | A list of marketplace identifiers. This specifies the marketplaces where the upload will be available. Only one marketplace can be specified.
content_md5 = 'content_md5_example' # String | An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
resource = 'resource_example' # String | The resource for the upload destination that you are creating. For example, if you are creating an upload destination for the createLegalDisclosure operation of the Messaging API, the {resource} would be /messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure, and the entire path would be /uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure.
opts = { 
  content_type: 'content_type_example' # String | The content type of the file to be uploaded.
}

begin
  result = api_instance.create_upload_destination_for_resource(marketplace_ids, content_md5, resource, opts)
  p result
rescue SpUploads2020::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling UploadsApi->create_upload_destination_for_resource: #{e}"
end
```
